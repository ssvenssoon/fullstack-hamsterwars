# Hamsterwars!

## Explanation

This is a fullstack app I've built for my school project. In this app you can vote for the cutest hamster in your opinion and also add your own customized hamster if you like.
You will be able to see all the important stats for each and every hamster and on the front page we will dislay the hamster with the most wins and fewest defeats.

This project is built with express(back-end), firebase(database) and react/typescript(front-end)
