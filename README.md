# fullstack-hamsterwars

This is a school project I made where you can vote for the cutest hamster. You can choose to fight two hamsters head to head. On the front page you can find the leading hamster wich means the hamster that has won the most games but also lost the fewest. 
If you want to you can go to the galleri to see all the hamsters, there you can delete a hamster but also customize your own.

The tools I've used for this project is firebase for the database, express for the backend and react with typescript for the frontend.
